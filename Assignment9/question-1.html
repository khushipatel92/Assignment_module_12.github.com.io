      ● What is JSON  
      
      Answer:
      
       -> JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data.
          JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page. JSON is "self-describing" and easy to 
          understand.


      -> JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a text-based, human-readable data interchange format used to exchange data 
         between web clients and web servers. The format defines a set of structuring rules for the representation of 
         structured data. JSON is used as an alternative to Extensible Markup Language (XML).
