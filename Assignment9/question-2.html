<!-- Question:2

      ● What is promises

     Answer:
     
     -> A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate 
        handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason.

     -> A promise is a commitment by someone to do or not do something. As a noun promise means a declaration assuring
        that one will or will not do something. As a verb it means to commit oneself by a promise to do or give.
